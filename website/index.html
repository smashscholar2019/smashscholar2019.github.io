  <div id="columns">
  <p> In life I have many things I values. I value things like loyalty, family,
    and education. Most importantly I value independece. I value independence
    the most because I am a very indepent person, and as a indepent person I feel
     like independence isn't something everyone values a lot.

  <p> I've always been a very indepent person, but personally I feel like through
     these past 2 year I have grown even more indepent. I have gone through
     situations that have made me feel like I have togrow fast and be indepent.
     It's a very important thing to me because many people aren't indepent which
      causes them to stuggle a lot in life. </p>
