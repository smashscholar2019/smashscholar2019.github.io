  <p><h2> Who am I ?   </h2>
     My name is Paola Gudalupe Hernandez Verdin. I am a 15 year old from
       the bay area. Growing up I've always wanted to have many different careers.
     In elemantry school I always wanted to be a teacher, in middle school
      I wanted to be a lawyer, but now that I am in high school, I want to be a dentist.</p>
<br>
<br>

  <p>    <h3> Why I choose this career? </h3>
  This career draws my attention for the reason that, I want to cause an impact
  in the children in my community. I want to cause an impact because I have
   noticed that when little kids go to the docot or dentist they don't like it
 and they are scared. I want to change that I want to be the one dentist that
  kids look forward to and enjoy going to.<br><br></p>

<p>
<br>

   <h3> What Impacted My Career choice? </h3>
I have been going to the same dentist since I was 5 years old. I
        really enjoy the dentist and look forward to going to the dentist
        everytime. My dentist was always really nice and patient with me and one
        time I had to go to a different dentist because of something that
         happened to my tooth. Being with a different dentist helped me
         realized that not all dentist are the same and some dentist treat
         their patients really bad. This motivated me to be a dentist but to
          work with younger kids.</p>
